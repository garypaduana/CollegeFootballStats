Parsing some college football stats: http://datahub.io/dataset/college-football-statistics-2005-2013

- Grab all the zip files for the years 2005-2013. They aren't terribly large. Each zip has CSV files with different stats. 
- Come up with a database schema to store them all. 
- Parse all the files and combine them into a database. 
- Extra credit if you also can combine all the unique stadiums referenced into an XML format of your invention. You don't need to do this in Java, but keep it mainstream.
